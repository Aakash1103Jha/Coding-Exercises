# Coding Exercises

The best way to learn something is through making mistakes, and that can happen only when you put in the work to practice.

Here I have a lot of small use-cases that I write code for in JS. Some questions are from leetcode, udemy DSA course, and even from Linkedin Learning.

_Main idea is to learn, and share_

If you find something that is not right, or if a certain code can be written in a better, more optimised way, please let me know ðŸ™‚
